# AI Assistant Rules

**CRITICAL: Always check documentation using Context7 before writing code with external libraries/frameworks.**

Fetch docs when:
- Writing React, Next.js, Vue, or any framework code
- Using any library (Tailwind, Express, etc.)
- Implementing specific features (hooks, APIs, routing)
- User mentions versions or you're uncertain about syntax

Use: `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` â†’ `mcp_context7_get-library-docs`
