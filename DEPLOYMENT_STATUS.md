# ✅ Deployment Status

## Setup Complete!

Your project is now deployed and configured for automatic Git deployments.

### 🚀 Deployed URLs
- **Preview:** https://evals-46jec167v-flitig.vercel.app
- **Production:** Will be assigned after environment variables are added

### 📋 What's Set Up

✅ Project linked to Vercel: `flitig/evals-lab`  
✅ Git integration enabled: `https://github.com/flitig-ai/evals-lab.git`  
✅ Initial deployment complete  
✅ Vercel dev running locally  
⚠️ Environment variables needed (see below)

### 🔑 Next Step: Add Environment Variables

Your API keys need to be added to Vercel. You have 3 options:

#### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/flitig/evals-lab/settings/environment-variables
2. Add these variables (get values from your local `.env` file):
   - `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_XAI_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
3. Select "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

#### Option 2: CLI (Interactive)
```bash
vercel env add VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY production
vercel env add VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY production
vercel env add VITE_XAI_API_KEY production
vercel env add VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY production
```

#### Option 3: Pull from .env
```bash
vercel env pull .env.vercel
# Then manually copy values from .env to Vercel dashboard
```

### 🔄 Auto-Deploy Workflow (Already Active!)

Now whenever you push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Build your app
3. Deploy to production
4. Notify you of the deployment

### 🧪 Local Development

Vercel dev is running in the background. Your app should be available at:
- http://localhost:3000 (check terminal output for exact port)

To stop: Find the process and kill it, or just close your terminal.
